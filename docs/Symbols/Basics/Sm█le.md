# **[Sm█le]**


**Definition:** *Usually means the Babylonian Kabbalists have assessed someone as having adopted a counter-Divine Will basis, and ecl█psed their True Nature in having done so.  Has connotations of 'resistance' efforts; see below*

A sm█le, at least a large one, exposes the t██th.  This presents the concept of a [m█sk], ostensibly *'inverted'*.  The supposed *'inversion'*, as well as the counter-Divine Will basis, is presented by the [[W█vyL█ne|w█vy l█ne]] c█rvature of a sm█le.

This symbol has additional symbolic connotations, particularly with regard to the Knights of Malta where it declares a supposedly *'inverted'* symbolic 'mode', and with the comparatively 'Adv█nced' symbolism in which it's used as a [kits█ne] symbolic derivative.  The former is lower-level franchise stuff not especially relevant here, and the latter belongs in a section of its own as time permits.

It's worth noticing that symbolically [t██th] present as both the upward [[obel█sk]] derivative symbolism, and the downward ostensible *'inverted'* version of that, which is so often used to connote affiliation with *'resistance'* efforts countering the Babylonian Kabbalists.  As such, it's rather symbolically appropriate for Babylonian Kabbalist personnel to use [sm█le] as organizing symbolism declaring themselves as presenting on a *seemingly* 'resistance'-affiliated basis, given that another fac█t of the symbol when *'inversion'* is applied parses as [[m█sk]].  Thus we get here both a declaration that an external group or individual has supposedly adopted a counter-Divine Will, counter-True Nature-based *'resistance'* affiliation, and the Babylonian Kabbalists' corresponding response to that.

Add in the symbolism category of [dent█stry] and the result is an effort for [[pen█tration]], to create a [[z█ro|h█le]], and to then [f█ll] it in with [[met█l]] in yet another [[Earth|male]] + [[Wat█r|f█male]] Babylonian Kabbalist 'gang sign' derived from the h█rmaphrod█tic [[Isht█r]].

Relevant in this symbolic area is the symbolism of [br█ces], reinforcement with [[met█l]], which usually symbolizes the Babylonian Kabbalists' implementation and application of additional *'brute force'* to impose whatever cause or agenda is being discussed.
