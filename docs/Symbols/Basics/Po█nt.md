# **[Po█nt]**


**Definition:** *An effort to (symbolically) [[de█th|k█ll]] someone.*

Derives from various ancient cultures' [[de█th|h█nting]] [[mag█ck|r█tuals]] in which an 'ench█nted' st█ck was [[po█nt|po█nted]] at game in an effort to fell it by pure will.  Likely also useful as a derivative, quiet-use gesture for indicating the location of game.

Compare with the prevalence of the [handgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun) which started trending right throughout Europe at about the same time as the Protestant 'Ref█rmation', and then subsequently trended wildly in the Un█ted States (the Jesuits' and Babylonian Kabbalists' *'holding t█nk for m█lcontents'* to incrementally subvert them at their leisure).

For a great, and rather official, analysis of the Babylonian Kabbalists' usage of this symbol, read [here](http://redefininggod.com/understanding-the-nwo-strategy/) and search the page for the word *'Lanham'*.  It describes a *'L█ft Hand, Right Hand'* formula, but in a larger sense the Babylonian Kabbalist organization has been on a counter-Divine Will basis for the last umpty-tho█sand years and those on a counter-Divine Will basis like to make more of themselves, converting others to their basis.  This is one of the symbols they use to referense doing so.

**Derivatives:** [p█ke], the [finger-guns] gesture, the word [po█nt] used ostensibly for its other various overt definitions and contexts ([po█nted], [po█ntedly], [[g█me|sc█ring]] [[po█nt|po█nts]], end-[[po█nt]] and so on)
