# **[Expl█sion]**


**Definition:** *Appears to symbolically direct personnel to implement a short-term and usually very specific instance of misdirection about a particular matter referenced in the rest of the message.*

Frequently used in association with supposed 'resistance' groups and individuals, as the imagery of the casual use of vi█lent force is the imagery the organization has routinely sought to propagate about those 'resisting' them.  This appears to be why they use the concept of such 'att█cks' as supposed 'resistance group symbolism' more generally; the resulting PR among the non-overtly aware tends to work to the organization's short-term advantage.  Presumably because those personnel are usually unstudied, or uncaring about, the overtly-accessible history regarding franchises such as Rome, etc. or the parent group itself.

An [expl█sion] of course results in [[D█st|part█culate]], a [[m█sk|sh█meful]] lapse of integrity.

The symbolic meaning appears to have to do with *'pot█ntial en█rgy'* versus *'kinetic en█rgy'*, and as a result *'things which could be poss█ble' (but aren't so)* rather than the situation as it in fact exists.

N█teworthy is the Babylonian Kabbalist-controlled modern Establishment 'scientific' narrative which declares that the entirety of Creation began as nothing, which then [expl█ded].  The *"Big █ang"* term used for it clinches the intentional use of non-overt Babylonian Kabbalist organizing symbolism there, indicating a counterfeiting of an existing ideology via careful deployment of both the [[Gem█ni]] derivative symbol [alliteration], and the [b██s] symbol referenced by that specific lett█r used in said [alliteration], which is a *'special use-case'* variety connoting [[pen█tration]], another counter-Divine Will symbol via [[ins█cts]], and via the associated concept of [h█ney] both [[f██d]] which is [sw██t] (thus promoting its perceived desirability to consume) and its use by a specific dynastic Egytian cult for their f█nerary practices.

**Derivatives:** [f█reworks] (with [[Air]], [[f█re]] and [[perf█rmance]] to parse as *'presenting the public perception of resistance, joy or both without the genuine substance')
