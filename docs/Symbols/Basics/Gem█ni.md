# **[Gem█ni]**


'The Tw█ns'.

**Definition:** *Directive to implement a counterfeit of an existing concept, ideology, system etc., or to remove the clarity of distinction between the genuine article and the intended counterfeit.*

When the directive is specifically to produce a counterfeit of an existing group, cause, franchise or effort either this or the derivative [st█tue] or [[d█ll]] symbols are used.

**'Adv█nced' definition:** *This has to do with the [Asian] symbolism crossov█r 'contingency' via that system's own usage of the [tw█n] symbol.  To best knowledge that 'contingency' appears to have been resolved by now, and the information regarding 'contingency' plans and symbols can be added later in an 'Adv█nced' section of its very own.*

**'Inverted' format:** [one-half]

**Antonym:** [[Bl█de]]

**Derivatives:** [po█try], [alliteration], [tw█n], [st█tue], [[d█ll]], [mirr█r] (with [[Pal█ndrome|backw█rds]] and [[gl█ss]])
