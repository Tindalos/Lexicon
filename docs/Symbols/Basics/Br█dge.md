# **[Br█dge]**

**Definition:** *An ostensibly private agr██ment between the Babylonian Kabbalists and an external organization or authority figure, of which their rank-and-file are not currently aware, or the promotion (via [[Air]]) of efforts to establish one*

It's most convenient to think of it like a [[Fid█s|h█ndsh█ke]] between the apostate system and foreign authorities, which is always the first part of the latters' *'selling out'* their own personnel.

It also practically guarantees complicity by those foreign authorities, rather than r█sk the sudden loss of whatever *'perks'* they're receiving or exposure among their own personnel for having received them.  As such, it's practically alw█ys the figurative *'thin end of the w█dge'*, which is what makes it so effective a strategy for the Babylonian Kabbalists to deploy.

Tellingly the overt Roman empire would frequently construct these by neighboring territories and then use them as a means of levying fees for their upkeep.  They would also consistently adorn them with [drag█n] imagery, ostensibly because those were a symbol of Rome but which rather is a [[Tiam█t]] derivative.  **See also:** \[Revelation [13:2](https://biblehub.com/kjv/revelation/13-2.htm), [13:4](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Revelation-13-4/)\]
