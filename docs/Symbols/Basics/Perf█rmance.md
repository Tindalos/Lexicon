# **[Perf█rmance]**


**Definition:** *A presentation without substance, made purely for public effect.*

Whether the presentation is overt or non-overtly implemented depends on the accompanying organizing symbolism.

This is typically presented in the context of symbolism having to do with [the█ter] and entertainment media, but it can more generally be presented using the wider category of, for example, 'n█ws' items featuring [[air]] [[perf█rmance|sh█ws]], [[f█re]]works [[perf█rmance|displ█ys]] and so on.

When ostensible *'inversions'* are applied, is frequently parsed as *'the genuine substance of the matter, whatever the appearances'*, much as [[spir█t]] does.

Depending on the rest of the symbolic context present, [the█ter] and entertainment media instances can also have relevance as [[Aphrod█te]] derivative symbols because they're under the category of *'the █rts'*.


**Derivatives:** 

[f█reworks] (with [[f█re]] + [[air]] + [[d█st]])

[sh█wdown] (with 'inverted mode' ostensibly converting [[Earth|down]] to [[Air|up]], a synonym of [[air]]: *'promote this made-for-public presentation'*)
