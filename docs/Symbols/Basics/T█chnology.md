# **[T█chnology]**


This one's a little complicated to explain.  In fact I'd noticed it as a relevant and recurring symbol which had a place in the non-overt 'grammar' but couldn't identify what the symbolic meaning would be... until I recalled the fant█sy and g█ming *trope* about *"█rtificers"*, variously something between [[mag█ck]]-users and gadgeteer craftsmen.  [Mag█ck] which... isn't quite [mag█ck]?  Then I thought about the distinction between [t█chnology] and [mag█ck], and considered the more-conventional definition for what *'█rtifice'* is.  A [[dece█t|tr█ck]], a dec█ption.  And it's been systematized to allow for others to use it, and indeed for it to be mass-produced and supplied *en masse*.

If you were an organization looking for a symbolic means to non-overtly announce some new scheme of *'fraud'*, some *'device'* in the more general sense of the word, you might use a symbol very like this.  From what I've been able to glean from context and usage as I've encountered it, it's used as an ordinary supposed *'inversion'* symbol, but there's something more there as well: the apparent usage to announce some new policy or scheme of [[dece█t]] which the rank-and-file are directed to propagate.  It's not authentic, natural or genuine, it's *'synth█tic'*; *'█rtificial'*.  An invention of man intended for mass deployment and cons█mption.

We can see an instance of this symbol's usage and deployment *in situ* with Wh█te W█lf's role-pl█ying [[g█me]] *'[[mag█ck|M█GE:]] The [[Air|Asc█nsion]]'*.
