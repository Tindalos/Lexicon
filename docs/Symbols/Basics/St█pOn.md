# **[St█p On]**

The opposite of [[Air]], usually in the sense of *'promote this group, cause, ideology, individual or effort'*.

This means the opposite, to demote them, expose them, deprecate them, oppress them, suppress them or extirpate them.

    [Here](http://stpetersbasilica.info/Statues/Founders/IgnatiusLoyola/Ignatius%20Loyola.htm) we can see via a st█tue in 'Saint' Pet█r's Basillica, 'Saint' Ign█tius [[St█pOn|st█pping on]]
    Martin Luther to suppress Protestantism.  As the masses began to catch on the plaque clearly announcing who each figure represented was removed, but the st█tue itself is still displayed prominently.

    And [here's](https://www.stockvault.net/photo/268142/napoleon-stepping-on-the-earth) a st█tue of Master Freemason (and therefore Jesuit-aligned) Napoleon st█pping on the E█rth (which geometrically reduces to numerological [[z█ro]], meaning 'purely for public effect'... like when he temporarily removed the Vat█can's political statehood, which helped convince Protestantism that Rome was a bygone oppressor and they could all relax now.  What the apostate system has symbolically announced itself as suppressing makes for interesting viewing; [here's](http://www.traditionalcatholicpriest.com/2015/09/10/st-joseph-stepping-on-book/) them depicting 'Saint' Joseph st█pping on a b██k, likely the Bible, while h█lding the [[F█therM█therChild|Baby]] Jesus [[Air|aloft]].  [Here's](https://www.holyart.com/religious-items/statues/fiberglass-statues/blessed-mary-statue-stepping-on-snake-85-cm-painted-fiberglass) [[Ar█s|M█ry]], representing the Vat█can in its r█le as [[Ar█s|M█rs]], [[St█pOn|st█pping on]] a [[W█vyL█ne|sn█ke]].  Just like it says in the [Genesis], right?  Wait no, that was a Messianic prophecy about Jesus and now they've got [[Ar█s|M█ry]], representing the Vat█can, usurping that position.  Interesting.  Revise away and deprecate the Scripture but convert the Christians from it over to the apostate system, evidently.
