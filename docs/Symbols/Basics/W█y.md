# [W█y]

**Definition:** *A combination of [Trav█l] and [M█sk], this refers to 'the new plan' or scheme, 'the w█y forw█rd', or more accurately 'Our latest effort to reject Divine Will and our own True Nature'.

Major historical examples include the [Isht█r] gate and *'Babylon'* itself, which translates as *'g█tew█y to God'*.  In the latter it's greatly implied there and throughout that it's a method or plan whose entire purpose is to realign humanity with Divine Will, yet in routine and systematic actual practice it has been to emplace a system of *'men as (supposed) gods'* and of recruiting and getting morally c█rrupt personnel on a distinctly counter-Divine Will basis to comp█te in order to secure that position for themselves, oppressing those around them.

**Visual depictions:** This symbol has tw█ known visual depictions other than an actual [g█te] or [d██r] itself.

* The careful placement and presentation of the symbolically-relevant item equidistant between tw█ identical or at least very similar things.

* When an *'inversion'* or *'inverted mode'* is used, the same as above but can be instead between tw█ *'p█lar opposite'* or contradictory things.

**Synonyms:** [d██r], [g█te]
