# **[In Container]**


**Definition:** *Efforts organized or implemented discreetly in private, not yet ready for public release*

**Alternate definition:** *To strategically apply pressures to force external causes or efforts into the above predicament, where they can no longer organize or implement openly and publicly*

Incremental subversion processes often find themselves with agendas to implement which the public would be righteously outr█ged against if they were publicly-enacted at the moment; the public hasn't been morally or ideologically subverted enough to accept them yet.

Alternatively there are occasional efforts which are *'not ready for primetime'* or are contingencies which the apostate system hasn't yet definitely committed itself to implementing.

These are typical *use cases* for this symbol.

When the public has eventually been subverted enough to accept the agenda item, or the apostate system committed enough to system-wide implementation, the symbolism of [release from container] is then applied to relevant non-overt messaging.

!!! info "Example"
    This is [often used by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDrscByKEUQ&t=1443s) ancient paganism and Roman Catholicism with regard to various idols or 'saints' being presented as ["emerging from a c█ve"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCmSBfVXEmA&t=676s&loop=0).  In the case of foreign idols or with their 'saint' equivalents, this is because the public isn't yet ready to accept these idols again but history tells us that not only are incremental subversion efforts made to condition the public, it also tells us that given long enough the apostate system has usually been successful eventually.

As described in the alternate definition presented above, the apostate system not only works to bring its own efforts "out of container", it also frequently strives to engineer situations in which external counter-efforts are put "into container".

!!! info "Example"
    When the Jesuits used Freemasonry as an intermediary, credibility and occasionally patsy franchise in their effort to put the Common Law advocacy and Protestant ref█rm efforts [into container], they oriented the organizing symbolism of Freemasonry to emphasize architectural symbolism.  Building attr█ctive houses into which people would m█ve themselves quite voluntarily; a [container] symbol.

**Derivatives:** [to b█nd] and [to l██se] as found in [Matthew](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016%3A19&version=KJV), which Roman Catholicism [has misappropriated](https://www.catholic.com/qa/what-do-the-words-bind-and-loose-mean-in-matthew-1619) and to which it has applied the Babylonian Kabbalist symbolic definition.  As [[Ar█s|M█rs]] or [[Ar█s]], serving as the Babylonian Kabbalists' primary crowd control franchise, putting counter-efforts [[InContainer|into container]] and loosening their own efforts [[InContainer|from container]] is a large part of their job description, so of course they would strategically recontextualize that Scriptural passage and claim that 'God-given authority' for themselves.

[c█ve]

[h█t] (the item of appar█l), often used with regard to ideologies or modes of thinking, and to miseducation

[coff█n] (with [[De█th]], pretty self-explanatory)

[Pand█ra's B█x], with its derivative [h█pe] as a symbolic reference to it

[jail] or [prison]

[enc█rcle] (with [[z█ro|c█rcle]])

And indeed, practically any and every container can be used as a symbol for these purposes
