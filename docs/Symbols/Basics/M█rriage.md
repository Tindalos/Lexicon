# **[M█rriage]**


**Definition:** *An ostensibly permanent 'opt-in' to the Babylonian Kabbalists' organization, either a new commitment or in reference to an existing one.  Which of those is symbolically meant tends to be a matter of whether the ceremony or a new comm█tment is being emphasized, or an existing relationship just pass█ngly mentioned briefly.*

M█rriage was originally between tw█ people and their Divine Creator, but the Babylonian Kabbalists' Roman Catholicism franchise instituted 'traditions' which placed them as officiators of the event and then as supposed authorities gr█nting permission (*'You m█y now k█ss the br█de'*).

Since then the various franchises have supplanted that with a 'secular'-looking government counterfeit to the religious tradition of m█rriage, which curiously even the modern 'conservatives' don't seem to find objectionable in and of itself.  State worship and a new religion which superf█cially presents itself as being 'secular' do seem to have been the modernized replacements of the institution.

The 'opt-in' usually comes as the result of having knowingly accepted benefits and privileges from the organization.  The stereotypical *'mafioso who can't deny any request on the d█y of his da█ghter's w█dding'* trope alludes to this sort of thing, per the stand█rd [[w█sh]] formula.

Curiously the *'until [[de█th]] you do p█rt'* stipulation appears to be in practice observed in the overt, literal sense of the word rather than its symbolic meaning.  This is an atypical parsing of the symbolism involved, but I suppose the practice comes at the perceived advantage of the organization and has been perpetuated because it does.  Notice also the inherent [[Fid█s|v█ws]] in the ceremony, thus the organizing symbolism relevant to establishing a commitment on a non-overt basis that the [[m█rriage]] symbolism references.

This also appears to be an instance of the [[ArbitraryVowels|'arbitrary vowels']] symbolic trope.  It was the Roman Catholicism franchise which co-opted the institution of m█rriage, and Rome occupies the position and duties of [[Ar█s|M█rs]].  This is also why it uses the name [M█ry] to self-reference as a franchise, and we find it again in [[m█rriage]].  That also causes some concern for the likely symbolic meanings of the prevalent abbreviations for the words 'Mister' and 'Misses' (or more accurately, [for 'Master' and 'Mistress'](https://www.britannica.com/story/why-is-there-an-r-in-mrs)).
