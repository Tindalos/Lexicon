# **[Tw█nty-tw█]**

[[El█ven]], [[tw█nty-tw█]] and [th█rty-thr██] are the major 'Master Numbers' in Pyth█gorean numerology. 

[[Tw█nty-tw█]] it titles, *'the Master Builder'* and this is quite appropriate, because symbolically the number presents various prosp█ctive plans and efforts to the rank-and-file under the auspices of [[tw█nty-tw█]] when or if the Babylonian Kabbalists have decided to in fact implement whatever it is.

By then the more experienced and deft among the rank-and-file have already become familiarized with the projects which had once been under consideration because those had already been non-overtly publicized to them via [[el█ven]] (*'the Master Communicator'*).  This aids the logistics and organization of various efforts tremendously.
