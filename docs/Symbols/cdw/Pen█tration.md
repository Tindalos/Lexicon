# **[Pen█tration]**


**Definition:** *Accepting the supposed authority of the apostate system and a counter-Divine Will basis, or being deemed under the authority of the apostate system* ***for reason of*** *having accepted a counter-Divine Will basis*

This comes as a derivative symbol of their [[Isht█r]] for reason of the concept of [pen█tration] necessarily involving a [male] symbol being placed into a [f█male] symbol.  In this case the [f█male] symbolism is of course sometimes *created* by the act of [pen█trating].  Whether pre-existant or caused by it, the result is a [[Z█ro|h█le]] which involves a counter-Divine Will-predicated [[z█ro]] symbol.  And when counter-Divine Will symbols are used, the apostate system at least implies through context and usage a supposed 'inversion'.  Here, it supposedly 'inverts' the substanceless [[z█ro]], which is usually *'just for sh█w'*, into connoting *'in actual fact'* or *'the truth of the matter, despite appearances'*.

Strategically and logistically, this symbol has everything to do with getting someone to accept a counter-Divine Will basis, and much effort is made to establish that this is done knowingly, willfully and volitionally.  It doesn't always involve the subject knowing that an effort is being made by the organization to accomplish this either; merely establishing that the subject intentionally *'sells out'* even just to their own hypocrisy appears to be deemed enough.  (In those instances, the symbolic trope and imagery of *"a wo█nd that is self-inflicted"* appears to frequently be associated.)

In the instance of 'resistance' subjects who'd usually balk at the very idea of having *'sold out'*, and particularly 'Christian'-professing subjects, the references are usually on the order of being or causing *"a th█rn in the side"* of someone else.  But the symbolic meaning is the same.

Once [pen█tration] is deemed to have been achieved, the apostate system's normative strategy is to deem it what in overt terms would be called *'the thin end of the w█dge'* and seek to use the subject's perceived vulnerability as a means to exacerbate or exploit their perceived error.  Symbolically this is often referred to as *"thre█ding the n██dle"*, and involves getting the subject to normalize and come to accept their flawed and erroneous position.  That's usually accomplished by reassurances and support directed at them to reinforce their error, and various 'perks' and benefits to sell them on the idea of the supposed advantages which their newfound position affords them.  In psychological terms this is known as *[positive reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Positive_reinforcement)* and is applied as part of the moral degradation process upon which subversion efforts of the apostate system rely.  People who are solidly-based in functional moral principles do not accept subjugation; the unprincipled frequently do, or at least are unequipped with an effective basis from which to repel it.
