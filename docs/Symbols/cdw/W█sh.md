# **[W█sh]**

**Definition:** *A desire perceived by the Babylonian Kabbalists as something that an individual is willing to accept in return for opting into a counter-Divine Will, counter-True Nature basis, supposedly irrevocably.  Typically the Babylonian Kabbalist personnel are required to make every reasonable effort to fulfill their desire on those terms, individually and even collectively, though which requests it opts to fulfill tend to be limited by something not entirely unlike current market rates; in eras and circumstances in which the buyout is deemed strategically of lesser importance, such as when great swaths of the public have already been 'selling out' or the person is deemed comparatively inconsequential, only lesser [w█shes] seem to be fulfilled*

This one c█mes to us yet again from ancient Babylonian and Persian mythology, [which later influenced the lore of subverted Judaism](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:The_Story_of_King_Solomon_and_Ashmedai).  [G█nies] or [dj█nn] were [w█sh]-granting non-physical entities who, as the lore narrowed itself down, were depicted as being on a counter-Divine Will basis under the authority of [Asm█deus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmodeus) and [in other versions [Sat█n]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCmSBfVXEmA&t=3735s&loop=0) who also re█gned over [dem█ns].  [We can see](https://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=55&verse=15) that the Qu'ran symbolically associates them with [[f█re]], which is unanimously accepted in all known translations.  

The earlier lore symbolically describes all manner of varieties and strategies used by these mythological entities, and appears to use the species as a symbolic depiction of the infiltrators and subversion personnel of the Babylonian Kabbalists.  Later folklore however reduces it almost exclusively to the fulfillment of desires which are inevitably less than satisfying, or some varieties which will fulfill said desires and [[de█th|k█ll]] the requestor immediately upon their fulfillment.  It all amounts to the same given the organizing symbolism involved.  The number of [w█shes] is of course [[thr██]], which is also consistent.

I have personally encountered the Babylonian Kabbalist system deploying this symbol, only to cease its application when it became clearly-understood by them that the individual rejected such terms entirely and categorically.  It did not however prevent the organization from proffering other various offers, and on the same terms, only to have those rejected too.

The organization does appear to have made frequent use of this in the context and phrasing of European aristocracy and ostensible nobility, favoring the term as a sort of agenda-motivated replacement for the earlier term *'will'*, as in the phrase, *'What is your will, sire?'*  Evidently [w█sh] was more appropriate to their organizing symbolism and efforts.  The larger result is certainly interesting: where once the Will of an authority figure prevalently regarded as being [Divinely-emplaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings) was deemed only respectful and dutiful to the Divine, the Babylonian Kabbalists appear to have incrementally subverted it into the concept of fulfilling desires only to obtain complicity with a counter-Divine Will basis.
