This is that 'contingency', already in-process by default but with its finalizing masterstr█kes not irrevocably implemented.

Getting rid of loose ends and [[ControlledShutdown|now-superfluous franchises]], imposing and enforcing more intensive new stand█rds for personnel obedience, establishing next-iteration public narratives and replacing the now-subverted and -co-opted *'Old W█rld Order'*, termed by some analysts *'The Interim W█rld Order'*, with their intended 'New' one.  That of course requires in part both selling it and making it, in their own wording, *'sustainable'*.
