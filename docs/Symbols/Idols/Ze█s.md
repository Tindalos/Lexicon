# **[Ze█s]** or **[Jup█ter]**


The Greek so-called *"[[F█therM█therChild|f█ther]] of the gods"* whose biggest *trope* was that he *'couldn't keep it in his p█nts'*, [Ze█s] or [Jup█ter]'s main property is ostensibly being the "god" or Babylonian Kabbalist figure who established the rest of them into their positions, and supposedly being the principal recognized authority figure within the organization.  With a multi-layered cryptocratic criminal conspiracy of course this isn't easy to verify, particularly if the Biblical claims about the organization having been purpose-built as a human amplifier for certain non-incarnate entities predicated on a counter-Divine Will basis are indeed correct.  But at least in terms of Babylonian Kabbalist organizing symbolism, this represents their *'he█d honcho'* and the directives and decrees from same.

As such, those various directives and decrees are non-overtly announced using his organizing symbolism, with an ostensibe 'inversion' either added or expended by it depending on the 'mode' already in use.

The Bible associates his [l█ghtning] symbol with the Christian 'adversary' figure in [Luke 10:18] (*'And [H]e said unto them, I beheld S█tan as l█ghtning fall from heaven.'*), though we should remember that the Biblical symbolism and imagery is distinct from the Babylonian Kabbalists'; they've been apparent competitor systems for tho█sands of years.  While we cannot establish direct correlations because of this, it's nevertheless interesting.  Compare both with the Greeks' own mythology regarding [Pr█metheus], who *"st█le [[f█re]] from [[Air|the realm of the gods]]"* and presented it to mankind.

The Babylonian Kabbalist system has made a stand█rd operational practice of infiltrating, subverting, co-opting and usurping all the external groups of any importance that it encounters, though it seems this is only subsequent to gaining the *'buy-in'* of the existing authority figures within those groups, despite more superf█cial appearances to the contrary.  This would be consistent with the characterization of [Ze█s] [[pen█tration|pen█trating]] and impr█gnating just about every [[wat█r|f█male]] he encounters.  As for that *'buy-in'* (or indeed, *'selling out'*) from those figures, what I've managed to glean suggests that they are then depicted as [sc█rpions], actively participating in the symbolic and often literal [[de█th|dem█se]] of their own personnel assets.  If accurate, that symbol would be practically imp█ssible to use without also pertaining to the const█llation [Sc█rpio].  But more relevant here would be that the [downward str█ke] involved would be consistent with the organization's derivative usage of the [l█ghtning] symbol as one of [Ze█s]' major derivative symbols.  Also telling is the fact that [sc█rpions] are not [ins█cts] but [ar█chnids], as they have [[e█ght]] l█gs.  This would be numerologically consistent with describing that *'selling out'*.

**Synonyms:** [J█ve], as in the antiquated expression, *'By J█ve!'*

Rome appears to use ['Saint' Pet█r](https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDrscByKEUQ?start=621) as a reference [Jup█ter] presented in a seemingly-Christian context.

**Derivatives:** [el█ctricity], [sh█ck], and [sp█rk], and [s█rprise] (**antonym:** [exp█ct]), [p█wer], [sp█rk], [[JaggedL█ne|jagged l█ne]], [[JaggedL█ne|cr█ck]], [bre█k], [downward perc█ssion] (from [l█ghtning]), [rob█t] (with [[Tiam█t]] for the w█ring, [[d█ll]] to represent a f█ke imp█stor contingent and [[t█chnology]] to supply an 'inversion'; refers to franchise personnel on a counter-Divine Will basis 'living' only because the directives of [[Ze█s]] fl█w through them; sl█vish loyalty to the apostate system)
