 *'The sign of Ta█rus is associated with several myths and [b█ll worship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Bull "Sacred Bull") from several ancient cultures. It was the first sign of the zodiac established among the [Mesopotamians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia"), who called it "The Great B█ll of Heaven," as it was the constellation through which the Sun rose on the vernal equinox at that time...'


*'Had█d was equated with the Greek god [[Ze█s]]'*

*'The human-headed winged b█lls [[InFr█ntOf|prot█ctive]] [[w█sh|g█nies]] called shedu or lamassu, ... were placed as gu█rdians at certain g█tes or d██rways of the c█ty and the palace. Symbols combining man, b█ll, and bird, they offered [[InFr█ntOf|prot█ction]] against en█mies.'*
