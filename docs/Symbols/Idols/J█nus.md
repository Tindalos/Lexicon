# **[J█nus]**


How the Babylonian Kabbalists provide fair notice to the rank-and-file personnel about the commencement of major new projects, the closure of prior ones, and the transition mark for the implementation of new policies.

Titular Roman idol after which [J█nuary] was named, as he represents beginnings and endings.

**Symbols:** Tw█ f█ces (one looking ahead, the other back), fo█r f█ces (looking similarly in opposite directions), g█tes and d██rways (lesser-used because they're too prevalent)

!!! info "Media instance"
    Just over an hour into *'Van█lla Sky'*, when Tom **[[Trav█l|Cru█se]]** we█rs his [[m█sk]] [[backw█rds]] when talking with Penélope **[[trav█l|Cr█z]].**  This provided a [tw█n] symbol, which becomes relevant with the 'contingency' scheme to be presented in the section for it concerning 'Advanced' symbols.
