# **[Aphrod█te]**


Pertains to the strategies of presenting new, supposedly publicly-acceptable efforts, in what appear to be intrinsically civilized, genteel, and be█utiful formats.  This increases the likelihood of public acceptance.  Also pertains to those well-ensc█nced within the organization maintaining a pristine, respectable-seeming public image and lifest█le, which enables them to non-overtly organize efforts via symbolism while keeping s█fely away from the more obvious crassness and baseness of the bottom-rung rank-and-file personnel, which could be usefully considered as the operation's 'grunts', and *'the thick of the action'* which they tend to be involved with.

Typically used in symbolic association with strategies and efforts which are deemed as-yet uns█llied enough in the public perception to be deemed pot█ntial liabilities.

Also implicitly suggests that the publicly-'villainized' figures propagated among [the 'limited exposure' campaign](https://web.archive.org/web/20160220093946/http://redefininggod.com/understanding-the-nwo-strategy/) for mass reviling by the 'troothers' are merely the mid-level minions and flunkies.

Could have par█llels with the association of Christianity's primary antagonist figure with "bea█ty", that is, well-seeming appearance distracting from a counter-Divine Will basis.

Associated with the plan█t [Ven█s], itself representing a non-overtly organized 'resistance' effort predicated on a counter-Divine Will basis.  Appears to be a Greek empire-era derivative of that earlier symbolism.
