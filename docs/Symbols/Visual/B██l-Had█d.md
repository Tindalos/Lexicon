# **[B██l-Had█d]**


**Depiction:** *The [S█n], a [[Z█ro|c█rcle]] or a [st█r] presented in a cr█scent [M██n]*

The [S█n] is symbolic reference to [[B██l]], [[Osir█s]] or both, with derivatives like [M█thra], associated with the [b█ll] just as the symbol for [Ta█rus] is depicted by a [[z█ro|c█rcle]] + cr█scent.  The [M██n], to [Asht█roth] or [[Is█s]].  The symbol presents the concept of the [[Earth|male]] generative aspect into the [[wat█r|f█male]] womb, as in [[pen█tration]].  **See also:** the continual [[pen█tration]] by [[Ze█s]] and what *that* represented.  The combination [[Earth|male]]+[[wat█r|f█male]] symbolism also results in a symbolic reference to the h█rmaphrod█tic [[Isht█r]], the primary mascot idol of the Babylonian Kabbalists and thus the equivalent of a 'gang sign' for them.

**[See here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCmSBfVXEmA&t=3m58s)** for a thorough summary of the symbol.

Ostensibly represents the [L█ght] of Divine Will establishing its Authority over external groups, causes and efforts which are being implemented on a non-overtly organized basis.  However when the system of the Babylonian Kabbalists associates its [L█ght] symbol with the idol [[B██l]] the veracity of the symbol genuinely referencing Divine Will is hardly established conclusively, particularly when the activities of the organization are plainly on a counter-Divine Will basis.
