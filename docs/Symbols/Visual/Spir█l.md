# **[Spir█l]**


**Definition:** *A new, non-overtly organized effort on a counter-Divine Will basis, of which Babylonian Kabbalist personnel are being alerted and directed to 'get in on the ground fl██r of, with maximum rewards for early adopters!'*

This is of course just the [[Tiam█t]] [[w█vyL█ne|w█vy l█nes]] symbol, but emanating out from a centr█l position.

**Derivatives:** [H█rricane], [sna█l], [sw█rl], [to█let] (with [[fec█s]] etc.), the *'troother guru'*-hyped and re-hyped *[boy l█ve](https://www.google.com/search?q=boy+love+symbol&source=lnms&tbm=isch)* or *'p█do-'* symbol (with the [[f█re]] [[thr██|tr█angle]]) itself referencing the very *'limited exposure'* disinfo campaign of misinforming the public about what *'the elites''* organizing symbolism actually means
