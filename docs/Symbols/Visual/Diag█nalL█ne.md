# **[Diag█nal L█ne]**


**Definition:** *A counter-Divine Will basis.  If the [[Stra█ghtL█ne|stra█ght l█ne]] for [[Earth|'overt']] convention indeed holds out, references it on an overt basis.*

I'm not entirely clear on where this one comes from.  I know Freemasonry uses vertical [[Stra█ghtL█ne|stra█ght l█nes]] on its 'layer' to ostensibly reference *'alignment with Divine Will'*, horizontal [[Stra█ghtL█ne|stra█ght l█nes]] to ostensibly reference *'a system or individual in such counter-Divine Will delapidation that it must be dem█lished or will soon dem█lish itself'*, and *very* diag█nal [[Stra█ghtL█ne|stra█ght l█nes]] to ostensibly indicate *'someone or something else which is not doing great with regards to upholding Divine Will'*, with the deviation from vertical being a supposed indicator of how great that variance is perceived to be.  However Freemasonry is primarily just a franchise of the Jesuits' franchise, and the Babylonian Kabbalist parent group regards each of these symbolic declarations not only in quite another context, but also as being self-referential of the one presenting the symbolism rather than the supposed topic of conversation.

I suppose it's likely that it derived instead from the angle at which the Christian 'Adversary' figure's h█rns, and a [go█t's], were set.

More likely is that it has something to do with more ancient stuff.  The tw█nty-sec█nd letter of the alphabet is frequently-deployed as an instance of this symbol, and that appears to reference the ancient Yiddish ["va█"](https://www.google.com/search?q=yiddish+vav&source=lnms&tbm=isch) symbol due to the pronunciation.  The Yiddish symbol references the number [[s█x]], a distinctly counter-Divine Will numerological symbol, and there's a hand gesture called [the tr█ple-va█](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126194644/http://redefininggod.com/2021/01/the-2020-archive-6/).  If you search-in-page with that last l█nk for the term *'Here is The Atl█ntic telegr█phing P█nce’s'* (minus the redactions), you'll see the hand gesture and a brief about its symbolic meaning.

Whatever the origin and derivation, the pattern of usage and non-overt grammer has certainly been consistent.  It's definitely a counter-Divine Will basis identifier symbol.  Occasionally you just get the pattern of usage confirmed, but haven't yet managed to locate its origin symbolism.
