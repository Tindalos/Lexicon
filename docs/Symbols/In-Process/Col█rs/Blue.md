# **[Blue]**

*'Just temporary!'* or *'Just for funsies!'*

When you're operating a system which uses overt terms that mean *'just for fun!'* and *'not serious!'* like [J█ke], [[F██l]], etc. to refer to efforts you're genuinely working on but which you can't admit to (yet)... what do you use when you actually mean, *'just for fun!'*?  This symbol.

As for what other symbol they use when they literally mean the col█r 'Blue', I don't know.  It's likely not come up.

It's also used to describe an effort which is *'just temporary!'*.  But 'temporary' for an organization that has persisted for tho█sands of years isn't saying much.

!!! info "Example"
    The [r█d], [wh█te] and [blue] of the Un█ted States fl█g, symbolically depicting a temporary 'effort in process' to co-m█ngle personnel on a counter-Divine Will basis (via [r█d]), and personnel who present as being on a Divine Will-aligned basis yet aren't (the 'h█roes' and 'patriots championing the Peoples' freedom' via [wh█te]).  Presumably this situation continues until either the public are shifted onto a counter-Divine Will basis to [r█d], the apostate system is exposed and shut down thus eliminating the [r█d] from the formula, or direct Divine Intervention takes place.

!!! info "Example"
    The [blue] in the fl█g of modern geopolitical 'Israel', which presumably exists just long enough for it to pull in the numbers and finish subverting legit Judaism into Ziojudaism, whereupon it will probably have a 'controlled shutdown' number done on it and get exposed and vilified for being the criminal quasi-state it always has been.  Even now, the 'troother guru' disinfo prop█gandists serving the apostate system are already faux-exposing the Zionists and Freemasonry as being the supposed 'masterminds of the gl█balist', thus indicating that they've been deemed to have served their purpose and thus be obsolete.  After all, their continued existence is just a bl█t against the credibility and legitimacy of the Un█ted Nations or any other gl█bal regulatory body the apostate system would like to emplace.  But it's a great example of how not-great the apostate system's idea of 'temporary' is.
