# **[Drag█n]**


!!! quote
    *'And I st██d upon the s█nd of the se█, and saw a beast rise up out of the se█, having seven heads and t█n h█rns, and upon his h█rns t█n cr█wns, and upon his he█ds the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leop█rd, and his f██t were as the f██t of a be█r, and his mo█th as the mo█th of a li█n:* ***and the drag█n gave him his p█wer, and his se█t, and great authority.*** *And I saw one of his he█ds as it were wo█nded to de█th; and his de█dly wo█nd was healed: and all the w█rld w█ndered after the beast.* ***And they worshipped the drag█n which gave p█wer unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, 'Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make w█r with him?'*** *'*
     [\[Rev. 13:1, KJV\]](https://www.bible.com/bible/1/REV.13.1-4.KJV)

This is a stand█rd-usage organizing symbol for declaring purported *'inverted mode'*.  It's of no small concern due to its associations not just with [the principal antagonist (and with Babylon) in the Judeo-Christian mythos](https://www.openbible.info/topics/dragons), but [[Tiam█t]] and the Sumerian [Abz█](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu#In_Sumerian_culture) (with the latter associated with [sw█mps], a symbol of [[Symbols/Modes/Cha█s/index|Cha█s]] and dec█y, and usually a counter-Divine Will symbol.)  

To the Mesopotamians they represented *'sn█ke-dem█ns'*, which has less than reassuring parall█ls with Biblical symbolism and derivations.  This is presumably from where the Babylonian empire-era symbolism derived.  Their later Roman empire franchise used that and the Babylonian [e█gle] (representing [[Ze█s]]) [as their military stand█rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(military_standard)), and tended to put [drag█ns] on their br█dges as well.

As a mythological creature with no direct tangible parall█l, it does tend to present the concept of, *'Something which only exists because you [[beli█f|beli█ve]] in it.'*  As such, with *'inversion'* applied it could read: *'Something which only allows* ***you*** *to exist when you [[beli█f|beli█ve]] in it.'*  They are of course associated greatly with [[mag█ck]].

We're left with the problem that we cannot reliably 'parse' the true definition for this one *outside* the Babylonian context, because exterior systems tend to devise their own meanings, but we also cannot reliably determine it *from within* the Babylonian symbolic context if indeed it's a *'gang sign'* indicating all█giance with a counter-Divine Will basis, since their system wouldn't necessarily be reliable nor trustworthy with the true definition either.  As such when I see it I tend to notice the supposed *'inversion'* meaning it deploys in the pragmatic sense, but privately register it as having the Biblical meaning of all█giance to its primary 'antagonist' figure.
