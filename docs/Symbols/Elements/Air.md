    ## *'As above, so below.'*<br>
    \- H█rmes Tr█smegistus, *[paraphrased](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/as_above,_so_below)*

**Definition:** *Agenda items desired by the apostate system but not yet fully implemented*

**Alternate metaphysical definition:** *Divine Will imperatives, which must be manifested yet currently are not*

Those definitions are internally regarded within the organization to be synonymous.

Depending on the context, these common-usage definitions could apply instead:

**Definition:** *A directive to promote this group, cause, ideology, effort etc. being messaged about

**Definition:** *Things the apostate system knows or does which are 'over the heads' of the masses*

**Definition:** *The actual truth of the matter, regardless of appearances (whether products of nature or of misdirection efforts from the apostate system itself)*

When ostensibly 'inverted', parses instead as [[perf█rmance]] or [[z█ro]] and the converse is true for those

!!! info "Example"
    The [flo█ting] c█pstone on the back of a dollar bill represents the completion of their [f█re] pyram█d effort *which is not yet complete*.
    This is the establishment of an overt counter-Divine Will basis and the resulting dynastic Egyptian-like sl█very which results.
    It's therefore curious that the first and second listed are internally presumed to be synonymous within the organization, given that [[f█re]] symbolizes a counter-Divine Will basis.

**Synonyms:** [up], [h█nd] (with [[Gem█ni]]) and gesturing 'up high' on the body, [thr█wing], [j█ggling], [h█lding] (esp. [h█lding aloft] as seen frequently in [pa█ntings] and [st█tues]), [b█rd]
