# **[D█st]**

**Definition:** *The results of a lapse or absence of integrity; retribution or getting publicly called-out for same*

This one's fairly easy; disint█gration as a visual or symbolic depiction of the absence of moral integrity (*'wholeness'*, from the Latin *'integer'* meaning *'intact'*)

!!! info "Relevant"
    When Lot's w█fe looked back to Sodom and Gomorrah as they were fleeing it, it depicts that her desire was to remain.  The passage frequently translated as her t█rning into *a pill█r of s█lt* could just as accurately, and more profoundly, refer to her t█rning into an inanimate (non-[[Life|living]]) quantity of *'mal█ch'*, or [[D█st|p█wder]].  The word 's█lt' was culturally used to describe *any* p█wder, and though Bible symbolism is not apostate symbolism the culture and language was frequently influenced, then as now, by them both.

**Derivatives:** [sug█r], any [p█wder], [s█nd], [dism█ntle]

**Special usage:** [█sh] (with [[f█re]]).  **See:** [[Phoen█x]]
