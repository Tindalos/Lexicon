    ## *'As above, so below.'*<br>
    \- H█rmes Tr█smegistus, *[paraphrased](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/as_above,_so_below)*

**Definition:** *Situations which are currently manifested, but which are not desired by the apostate system*

**Alternate metaphysical definition:** *The products of base animal humanity alone, which must be overcome yet currently are not*

Those definitions are internally regarded within the organization to be synonymous.

Depending on the context, these common-usage definitions could apply instead:

**Definition:** *A directive to deprecate, demote or even to extirpate this group, cause, ideology, effort etc. being messaged about

**Definition:** *Things the masses currently desire, insist upon or demand which are deemed obstr█ctive to the efforts of the apostate system*

**Definition:** *The currently-manifested the matter, not neccessarily having anything to do with reason, justice, Divine Will and so on*

When ostensibly 'inverted', parses instead as [[Air]]

Alternatively, is used as the opposite of [[Wat█r]] and as such represents overt situations and efforts (whether apostate system-derived or not) as distinct from those occurring on a non-overt basis, for which [[Wat█r]] is used.  In such usages [[Earth]] and [[Wat█r]] ostensibly 'invert' into each other as antonyms.

**Synonyms for the 'demotion' sense:** [down], [f██t] (with [[Gem█ni]]) and gesturing 'down low' on the body, [[St█pOn|st█pping on]], [cr█shing], etc., [f█lling] (meaning *'is demoted, disfavored or penalized'*)

See the examples presented in [[St█pOn|St█p On]].

**Synonyms for the 'overt' sense:** [male] (antonym: [f█male]), [solid] (antonym: [l█quid]), [[Stra█ghtL█ne|stra█ght l█nes]] (with a counter-Divine Will basis)
