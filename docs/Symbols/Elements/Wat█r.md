# **[Wat█r]**

**Definition:** *A non-overt, symbolically-organized basis or efforts organized on same*

This is used for example to distinguish narratives being propagated to symbolically-aware outsiders from events the apostate system engineers and implements overtly, such as tangible w█rs, financial cr█shes and the like.

Geometrically depicted by an equilateral tr█angle with its top l█ne horizontal, **see:** [[Do█bleTr█angle|Do█ble Tr█angle]] in which it is superimposed on the [[f█re]] tr█angle.  This could also explain one of the [tr█angle gestures](https://www.google.com/search?q=politicians+triangle+gestures&source=lnms&tbm=isch) the 'troothers' have been so concerned about the politicians making, likely because they don't appear to be diff█rentiating between a [[F█re|f█re]] and a [[Wat█r|wat█r]] tr█angle.

**Synonyms:** [The M██n], [f█male], [f█minine], [fl█ctuation], practically any [l█quid], [[W█vyL█ne|w█vy l█nes]] (with a counter-Divine Will basis; **see:** [[Tiam█t]])
