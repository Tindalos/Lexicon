# **[Dec█pitation]**

**Definition (supposed):** *For 'resistance' personnel, the idea of supposedly removing the he█d, the le█der, of an organization from their position of perceived authority, by force and perhaps even by l█thal force*

**Definition (actual):** *For the Babylonian Kabbalists, inciting a disenfranchisement of the public or the personnel of a group ('the b█dy politic') with their authority figure ('the he█d'), and more generally the dissociation of an individual, a group or the general public from their own reasoning faculties.  In its most general sense, to give someone completely the wrong idea about a situation and even the context within which to assess it*

Humanity encountered plenty of instances of this during the major public fraud mistermed the French 'Rev█lution' in which [[dec█pitation]] became systematized, and in which the Jesuits were deliberately seeking to effect an overt political 'regime ch█nge' and to incite the public outr█ge against their aristocracy in order to establish the support base to not only accept but actively demand it.  I've made quite a study of the French 'Rev█lution' fraud and its motives, its methods and its organizing symbolism and presented it in My *'The Rhetoric Factory'* series piece entitled *['Fraud 'Rev█lutions', and the New Religion'](http://DivineWillAssembly.com/2021/03/07/the-rhetoric-factory-fraud-rev-lutions-and-the-new-religion/)* starting on page tw█nty-fo█r.

Readers will notice that in most usages, the [[dec█pitation]] is brought about with the use of [[Ar█s|ir█n]] or [[Ar█s|st██l]].  The latter is just a modernized version of the former, and as such both symbolically reference [[Ar█s]] or [[Ar█s|M█rs]].  And *that* is a position which Roman Catholicism has long occupied, ever since the Roman empire was found to be ineffective in suppressing Christianity by force, went down for a few cent█ries for 'retooling', and the relevant personnel were redirected to present as Roman Catholicism instead.  Rome in both its previous and its present 'incarnations' has been the primary *'crowd control'* franchise of the Babylonian Kabbalists, concerned with using overt and non-overt methods to get the public and particularly counter-efforts opposed to tyr█nny 'on-side' and using brute force whenever necessary or expedient in order to retain the support base for the apostate system.

Readers familiar with the 'troother' social media prop█ganda will also recognize [[dec█pitation]], particularly via [[dec█pitation|guill█tines]], as having made a modern reappearance quite frequently.  This is because the Jesuits have been non-overtly organizing yet another, modern instance of the French 'Rev█lution' fraud they'd perpetrated with that event, and symbolically referencing it is part of their non-overt organizing of personnel assets for the effort.
