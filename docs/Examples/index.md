# **Examples**

### Recurring tropes in mass media:

[[Perf█rmance|Show]][[Earth|down]] 

[[Rot█tion|Ratchet]] [[Air|up]] ([Rot█tion] + [Air])

[[St█pOn|Thrown under]] the [[Trav█l|bus]]

[[Rot█tion|T█rning]] a corner (with [[trav█l]]; a [[MultipleInProcess|multiple efforts-in-process]] trope setting up a misdirection in which the situation is exactly the same, but will suddenly look very diff█rent to someone.)

The [[Seven|perfect]] [[Ze█s|st█rm]] (with [[spir█l]], presumably)


### Recurring tropes in 'troother' prop█gandists:

W█king up ([[Dre█m]] with an 'inversion')

[[Air|Ascension]], [[Air|Rising]]

down the rabbit h█le ([fertility] + [[z█ro]] + [[InContainer|in container]] + [[Earth|down]]], which 'inverts' to [[Air|up]])

Le█ks

"Q" ([[Z█ro|c█rcle]] + [[Diag█nalL█ne|f█rty-f█ve degree angle]], with a release from [[InContainer|container]] ostensibly 'inverted')

"Bre█dcr█mbs" ([[f█re]] + [[f██d]] + [[D█st|part█culate]], and a reference to organizing symbolism from the Grimm's fa█ryt█le.]])

Predictive programming ([[Gem█ni]] via [alitteration]; a counterfeit ideology they've been propagating)

"Five-Gee" [[F█ve]] + [[Air]] + ([[W█vyL█ne|W█vy L█nes]])

"[[Thr██]]-dimensional ch█ss" ([[Bl█ck]] and [[Wh█te]], [[Earth]] + [[Fo█r|Squ█re]], and a [[g█me]] absolutely chock-full of Babylonian Kabbalist symbolism in which any lesser piece of any gender can become the [[Wat█r|Qu██n]], but in which the overt legitimacy depends upon the [[Earth|K█ng]].)

"[[Trav█l|going]] [[Fo█r]]-D", "[[Trav█l|going]] [[F█ve]]-D"

[[Earth|Deep]] State (*'an effort to deprecate the existing overt government regime'*)

*"patriot [[Wh█te]] [[InContainer|H█ts]]"* and the *"nifferous Deep State [[Bl█ck]] [[InContainer|H█ts]]"*

gu█llotines

SHTF

"[[Spir█l|Dra█ning]] the sw█mp"

Tr█mp ([[Or█nge]] [[Earth|Man]])

"[[Met█l|t█nfo█l]] [[InContainer|h█t]]"

Info[[W█r|W█rs]] (overtly from the recent, U.S. military-developed organizing term *'information w█rfare'*)

[[R█d]] [[F██d|p█ll]], [[Blue]] [[F██d|p█ll]]

"[[Air|Lifting]] the [[M█sk|ve█l]]" (with [hanging down] + an implication of [[m█rriage]])

"Discl█sure" ( [[NoAnti|No 'Anti-']] + [[InContainer|In container]])

"[[NoAnti|I DO NOT CONSENT]]"

'the p█dophile symbol' (Greek elemental [[F█re]] [[Thr██|Triangle]] + [[Spir█l]])

The *other* 'p█do symbol', "[[R█d]] [sho█s]" ( [[R█d]] + [[Gem█ni|tw█n]] + '[[Air|up]]', inverted)

"[[Ze█s|St█rm]] is [[Trav█l|coming]]" (variously [Th█r] for the Germanic-oriented f█scist lower-layer franchise personnel)

"[[Ze█s|k█yboard]] [[W█r|w█rriors]]"  (with the purported symbolic 'inversion' being that the term conventionally refers to people who talk a lot on the intern█t but won't actually do jack in terms of upholding it with action; appears to be a snub of their own 'patriot troother' audience)

"[[F██d|t█ble]]-[[Rot█tion|fl█pping]]" ( [[F██d]] + [[Air]] + [[rot█tion]])

"Th█y Live" ( [[Perf█rmance|F█lm]] + S█ngl█sses ( [[M█sk]] + [[Gl█ss]] + [[D█rkness]]) + [[Life]] 'inverted')

"[[g█me]]-[[Ch█nge|ch█nger]]"

"Make it [[Trav█l|go]] [[Vir█s|vir█l]]!"

"Dr█nking the K██l-Aid" ( [[Dr█nk]] + [[Corporation]] + [[D█st]])

"[[Drag█n|Rept█lians]]"

"[[Z█ro|gl█balists]]" (with their [[ShapesAsNumbers|shapes-as-numbers]] trope, which gives it a numerological [[Z█ro]] meaning.)

"New [[Z█ro|W█rld]] Order" as above; refers to who or what *appears* to be controlling the w█rld (or trying to) as opposed to who or what actually *is*.

"conn█ct the d█ts"
