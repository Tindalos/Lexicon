# Examples

### **Recurring tropes in mass media:**

[[Perf█rmance|Show]][[Earth|down]] 

[[Rot█tion|Ratchet]] [[Air|up]] ([Rot█tion] + [Air])

[[St█pOn|Thrown under]] the [[Trav█l|b█s]]

[[Rot█tion|T█rning]] a corner (with [[trav█l]]; a [[MultipleInProcess|multiple efforts-in-process]] trope setting up a misdirection in which the situation is exactly the same, but will suddenly look very diff█rent to someone.)

The [[Seven|perfect]] [[Ze█s|st█rm]] (with [[Spir█l]], presumably)

[[Trav█l|Br█nging]] everyone to the [t█ble] ( [[f██d]] + [[air]])

Scr█mbling ([[rot█tion]] + [█gg] (which is [[z█ro]] + either [[wat█r|l█quid]] or [[oobl█ck]] since they're [[Earth|solid]] when c██ked, and of course [[f██d]]).  Refers to trying to get outsiders to accept some new non-overt code str█cture as valid, usually suspected 'resistance' personnel)

Routinely misusing [[Tiam█t|"qu█stion m█rk"]] instead of 'qu█stion'

"[[NoAnti|f█ke n█ws]]" (referring to what the one using the term, not the one being accused of it, is doing; announces a [[dece█t]] or fraud against others.  The w█y to phrase that legitimately instead would've been to describe it as an "[[NoAnti|untruth]]".)

"Situation [[Rot█tion|unf█lding]]"

"[[Obel█sk|pol█rized]]" 


### **Recurring tropes in 'troother' prop█gandists:**

W█king up ([[Dre█m]] with an 'inversion')

[[Air|Ascension]], [[Air|Rising]]

down the rabbit h█le ([fertility] + [[z█ro]] + [[InContainer|in container]] + [[Earth|down]] (which would 'invert' to [[Air|up]]) )

"[[Ar█s|Le█ked]]" information (it's just [[Ar█s|pl█mbing]] with a supposed 'inversion', though it's meant to resemble a "ur█nation" symbol that 'resistance' personnel would use.  Trope frequently used by Knights of Malta who use "ur█ne" to represent receiving methamph█tamine bonuses for countering actual 'resistance' efforts.)

"Q" ([[Z█ro|c█rcle]] + [[Diag█nalL█ne|f█rty-f█ve degree angle]], with a release from [[InContainer|container]] ostensibly 'inverted')

"Bre█dcr█mbs" ([[f█re]] + [[f██d]] + [[D█st|part█culate]], and a reference to organizing symbolism from the Grimm's fa█ryt█le.]])

"Predictive programming" ([[Gem█ni]] via [alitteration]; a counterfeit ideology they've been propagating)

"F█ve-Gee" [[F█ve]] + [[Air]] + ([[W█vyL█ne|W█vy L█nes]])

"[[Thr██]]-dimensional ch█ss" ([[Bl█ck]] and [[Wh█te]], [[Earth]] + [[Fo█r|Squ█re]], and a [[g█me]] absolutely chock-full of Babylonian Kabbalist symbolism in which any lesser piece of any gender can become the [[Wat█r|Qu██n]], but in which the overt legitimacy depends upon the [[Earth|K█ng]].)

"[[Trav█l|going]] [[Fo█r]]-D", "[[Trav█l|going]] [[F█ve]]-D"

[[Earth|Deep]] State (*'an effort to deprecate the existing overt government regime'*)

*"patriot [[Wh█te]] [[InContainer|H█ts]]"* and the *"nifferous Deep State [[Bl█ck]] [[InContainer|H█ts]]"*

gu█llotines

[[Fec█s|S]]HT[[Rot█tion|F]]


"[[Spir█l|Dra█ning]] the [[M█d|sw█mp]]"

Tr█mp ([[Or█nge]] [[Earth|Man]])

"[[Met█l|t█nfo█l]] [[InContainer|h█t]]"

Info[[W█r|W█rs]] (overtly from the recent, U.S. military-developed organizing term *'information w█rfare'*)

[[R█d]] [[F██d|p█ll]], [[Blue]] [[F██d|p█ll]]

"[[Air|Lifting]] the [[M█sk|ve█l]]" (with [hanging down] + an implication of [[m█rriage]])

"Discl█sure" ([[NoAnti|No 'Anti-']] + [[InContainer|In container]])

"[[NoAnti|I DO NOT CONSENT]]"

'the p█dophile symbol' (Greek elemental [[F█re]] [[Thr██|Triangle]] + [[Spir█l]])

The *other* 'p█do symbol', "[[R█d]] [sho█s]" ( [[R█d]] + [[Gem█ni|tw█n]] + '[[Air|up]]', inverted)

"[[Ze█s|St█rm]] is [[Trav█l|coming]]" (variously [Th█r] for the Germanic-oriented f█scist lower-layer franchise personnel)

"[[Ze█s|k█yboard]] [[W█r|w█rriors]]"  (with the purported symbolic 'inversion' being that the term conventionally refers to people who talk a lot on the intern█t but won't actually do jack in terms of upholding it with action; appears to be a snub of their own 'patriot troother' audience)

"[[F██d|t█ble]]-[[Rot█tion|fl█pping]]" ([[F██d]] + [[Air]] + [[rot█tion]])

"Th█y Live" ([[Perf█rmance|F█lm]] + S█ngl█sses ( [[M█sk]] + [[Gl█ss]] + [[D█rkness]]) + [[Life]] 'inverted')

"[[g█me]]-[[Ch█nge|ch█nger]]"

"Make it [[Trav█l|go]] [[Vir█s|vir█l]]!"

"Dr█nking the K██l-Aid" ([[dr█nk]] + [[corporation]] + [[d█st]])

"[[Drag█n|rept█lians]]"

"[[Z█ro|gl█balists]]" (with their [[GeometryAsNumbers|shapes-as-numbers]] trope, which gives it a numerological [[Z█ro]] meaning.)

"New [[Z█ro|W█rld]] Order" as above; refers to who or what *appears* to be controlling the w█rld (or trying to) as opposed to who or what actually *is*.

"[[Stra█ghtL█ne|conn█ct]] the d█ts" (an overt 'effort in process' to do something; in this case to get people to form new mental associations between concepts, being done from a counter-Divine Will basis)

"You are the [[Bl█ck|carb█n]] they want to reduce" (dutifully organizing who the supposed public 'villains' are)

*"[[F██d|Eat]] ze [[ins█cts|b█gs]]"*  ([\[meme\]](https://www.google.com/search?q=eat+ze+bugs+meme&source=lnms&tbm=isch), [\[parodies\]](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-will-not-eat-the-bugs), ***all*** of which helped trend and propagate the organizing symbolism)

"wh█stlebl█wers" ([[Aphrod█te]] + [[Z█ro|c█rcle]], with another counter-Divine Will symbol thrown in via the Knights of Malta franchise using wh█stling as both a downlow s█xual recruitment symbol and a 'gang st█lking' harassment method which seems innocuous enough when you encounter it once or twice, but is designed to set off PTSD in the vict█m when they encounter people around them doing it frequently and consistently wherever they are.  The 'l█ps' involved are also derivative symbolism of [[Tiam█t]]'s [[W█vyL█ne|w█vy l█nes]], and both [[obel█sk]] and its [ups█de down] *'inverted'* format)

"c█lcification of the pineal gl█nd" ( [[De█th|b█ne]], [[Ch█kras|th█rd eye]], putting [[InContainer|in container]]: organizing an effort to gain control of perception faculties and thinking)
