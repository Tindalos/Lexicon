# *'Who are these guys, anyway?'*

Oversimply, the organization appears to have started back in dynastic Egypt and Babylon, perhaps a little earlier in Sumeria.

It was ostensibly established as a means of ensuring that some rather valid and important Divine Will principals would be consistently recognized, upheld and enforced, and that the system doing so would spread and proliferate the w█rld over.

Given that the organization's methods have been self-evidently defying Divine Will in the interim, and that their organizing symbolism purportedly regarding Divine Will instead has been looking 'iffy' and likely represent a counter-Divine Will basis instead, the jury's still out on that.  The organizational Divine Will claim has been exceptionally useful in terms of gaining and retaining personnel confidence and loyalties, but given the actual results that could very well be merely a rather shrewd motivation for the organization's claims.

But spread it has.  This is predominantly due to the fact that it organizes and implements its personnel and agendas via both overt and non-overt means (see more on that under [[[Isht█r]]] ).  This means its personnel not only implement agendas overtly, they're effectively espi█nage agents who collectively work to underm█ne whole governments, religions, f█rms of law, economies and societies by organizing and interoperating using organizing symbolism.  This of course means that personnel assets can overtly present as practically anyone, from 'ordinary folks' to moneyed elite to influential public figures, and appear to be supporting or promoting essentially any position or ideology.  And just like as with more conventional efforts to thwart more conventional organized crime groups, removing the principals doesn't stop the formula because its broad support base just means that personnel merely 'move up' to occupy the resulting p█wer vacuum.
