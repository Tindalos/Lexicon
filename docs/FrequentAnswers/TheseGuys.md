# *'Who are these guys, anyway?'*

Oversimply, the organization appears to have started back in dynastic Egypt and Babylon, perhaps a little earlier in Sumeria.

It was ostensibly established as a means of ensuring that some rather valid and important Divine Will principals would be consistently recognized, upheld and enforced, and that the system doing so would spread and proliferate the w█rld over.

Given that the organization's methods have been self-evidently defying Divine Will in the interim, and that their organizing symbolism purportedly regarding Divine Will instead has been looking 'iffy' and likely represent a counter-Divine Will basis instead, the jury's still out on that.  The organizational Divine Will claim has been exceptionally useful in terms of gaining and retaining personnel confidence and loyalties, but given the actual results that could very well be merely a rather shrewd motivation for the organization's claims.

But spread it has.  This is predominantly due to the fact that it organizes and implements its personnel and agendas via both overt and non-overt means (see more on that under [[Isht█r]]).  This means its personnel not only implement agendas overtly, they're effectively espi█nage agents who collectively work to underm█ne whole governments, religions, f█rms of law, economies and societies by organizing and interoperating using organizing symbolism.  This of course means that personnel assets can overtly present as practically anyone, from 'ordinary folks' to moneyed elite to influential public figures, and appear to be supporting or promoting essentially any position or ideology.  And just like as with more conventional efforts to thwart more conventional organized crime groups, removing the principals doesn't stop the formula because its broad support base just means that personnel merely 'move up' to occupy the resulting p█wer vacuum.

The organization's penchant for using both overt and non-overt methods results in a system whereby when confr█nted with any significant thre█t it can effectively 'de-coalesce', with its more 'in the know' members abandoning whatever overt loyalties, positions and regimes they've appeared to be supporters of (while abandoning the less-advanced or less-favored personnel to get soundly trounced by the external thre█t), making the whole operation appear to cease and be vanquished.  The personnel of course instead continue to interoperate, coordinating through exclusively non-overt means, and 're-coalesce' as what appears to be some other agency completely... usually within whatever external thre█t attempted to vanquish them, infiltrating, subverting, co-opting and usurping it until the new host has been completely taken over by the organization.  It then becomes just another pet franchise of the original group, which incrementally subverts the franchise to function more and more as the original group once did in its heyd█y.  And as the organization regains control of the situation, f██ls 'safer' and the thre█t neutralized, it directs its personnel to act on an increasingly more overt basis once again.  In short it 'terraf█rms' its host franchises into the top-down authoritarian Babylonian model, wielding the clout of both the government and religion, along with plenty of non-overt support base, and the extent to which it successfully accomplishes this in any era is a clear indicator of how much opposition it's been encountering and how effectively the public have been upholding a set of functional foundational principles which the agendas of the organization always seek to overthrow for its own perceived organizational gains.

Since it uses organizing symbolism and the symbolism of the parent group has effectively remained consistent since dynastic Egypt and Babylon, this enables us to 'tr█ce' its existence and succession of 'incarnations' through various overt regimes to the present.  Very basically,
