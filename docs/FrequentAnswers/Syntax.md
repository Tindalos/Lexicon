# Lexicon syntax
With the apostate system adding their own multiple definitions to ordinary words and terms, a system is needed for re-establishing in which sense we mean them.  Here's Mine.

`█`

:    Redaction mark, 'denatures' a symbol in order to use the word without applying the symbol

: Used for exposing a symbol or just trying to use the language without getting misinterpreted as using non-overt symbolism

`[ ]`

:    Legal meaning: *'for informational purposes only'*
:    Ordinarily used to connote reference to the symbolic definition of a word
:    However Obs█dian's syntax tends to interfere with that, converting into URLs without those characters when there's a Lexicon entry for that symbol

`''`

:    Specifies that I'm using a word or term in its ordinary, non-symbolic, overt sense

`""`

:    Specifies that I'm using a word or term in its symbolic, non-overt sense

`Me, My, Myself`

:    Generally k█ngs and the papacy use self-capitalization to declare that they, themselves, are 'Divine'
:    I use it to remind they and the People that all rights and legitimate authority is Divine Will-derived, and having a claim on either is contingent with alignment with Divine Will
:    Also to clearly declare that My Choice of basis is that which is in alignment with Divine Will
