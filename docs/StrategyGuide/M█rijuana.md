# [M█rijuana]

**Summary:** *An attempt to get someone to accept others on a counter-Divine Will basis through non-overtly inciting them to, 'Ignore those symbols!', usually on the implied premise that they're not being on a symbolically-relevant basis.*

[Recreational subst█nce] is for the Babylonian Kabbalist system just a recontextualized version of their [[F██d]] symbol.  On the lower 'lay█rs' it's deemed more acceptable among *'resistance'*-identifying individuals, where it's ostensibly a 'misdirection' declarator symbol used by those who identify with 'anti-Establishmentarian' *'resistance'*.  And on that lower 'lay█r', those affiliated with the supposedly-competing 'Establishmentarian', pro-authoritarian government 'franchise' deploy it when they're using an ostensible *'inverted'* mode, because the franchise identifier is merely regarded to be *'inverted'*; the 'misdirection' connotation remains the same.  Of course this lower 'lay█r' symbolism is effectively irrelevant to the Babylonian Kabbalist 'lay█r' and is merely deployed for looks and convenient strategy, as their supposed *'resistance'* and 'authoritarian government' 'factions' are mere distractions and busyw█rk while they implement their grander designs.

So the Babylonian Kabbalist symbolism here reduces to: [[f██d]] + [[f█re]] + [[m█sk]] + [[spir█t|sm█ke]].

**Translation:** *'An attempt to get someone to accept a counter-Divine Will, counter-True Nature basis via offering perceived value in it to them.'*

[M█rijuana] and its associated symbols and imagery have this implication.  Additionally, the Roman Catholic franchise uses [M█ry] as a group identification symbol (read: *'gang sign'*) for itself, while the Babylonian Kabbalist 'lay█r' uses it to symbolically reference the [[Is█s]] subdiv█sion via that [[Tropes/F█therM█therChild|M█ther]] symbolism and also apparently to [[Ar█s|M█rs]] via the [[ArbitraryVowels|'arbitrary vowels']] method.
