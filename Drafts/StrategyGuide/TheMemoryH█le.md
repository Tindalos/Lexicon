# The Memory H█le

*'Over time this allows them to cl█ck-and-dr█g ['The Overton Wind█w'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) practically anywhere they'd like around the deskt█p, revising majority public opinion to support whatever they'd like.  Of course it does result in major societal instabilities because support for viable foundational principles has been removed, but the apostate system usually compensates for this by using sl█ck rhetoric and agitpr█p to blame them on some other supposed causes they'd like to incite the public to get rid of next, and replace it with something else advertised as the next great new thing to solve the current problems.'*

Examples: Revisions of legal dictionaries, 'w█keism', Common Law as 'merely case precedent', etc.
