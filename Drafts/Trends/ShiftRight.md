# Shift Back to the Right


In mid-tw█nty tw█nty I posted **[a public alert](http://DivineWillAssembly.com/2021/07/12/public-alert-knights-of-malta-redeployment/)** of a non-overt trend I'd noticed about a year before that via social media.  It was a directive to put the Knights of Malta personnel back into temporary [[Air|asc█ndancy]] relat█ve to the stereotypical organized crime franchises.  It took some time to confirm the non-overt pattern, and then establish that yes, the Babylonian Kabbalists were still implementing it.

What does this mean in practice?  It's like a *'pend█lum sw█ng'*.  The organized crime franchise used to do the brunt of the opi█id importation and distribution, while the Knights of Malta franchise did the c█caine and m█thamphetamine import, manufacture and distribution, along with much of the overt supposed *'law enforcement'* via the thuggish cops, CIA, FBI and so on.  The franchises had been set into supposed 'opposition' against each other both overtly and non-.  But in the last few dec█des they've each transitioned from a primarily service and product-based distribution model into promoting trending sociopolitical ideologies and *'in-crowd groupthink'*.

The organized crime did the *'social justice'*, *'identity politics'*, *'forced multiculturalism'*, *'LGBTQI++'*, communism, socialism, *'tr█ns rights'*, *'w█mens' rights'*, hyperlib█ral extremism, labor un█ons and so on.  Their designated *'opposite number'* franchise the Knights of Malta by contrast promoted the Republicanism, pseudo-*'conservativism'*, casual r█cism and misog█ny, h█wkish foreign policy, worship of unlimited state authoritarianism, general 'jock thug' mentality, and with the Jesuits the pseudo-Christian *'churchianity'*.  They're also responsible for much of the *'Lib█rtarianism'* and *'Voluntaryism'* more recently, as both are professed support of the Common Law heritage, tradition and values in the States while instead quite actively subverting it by substituting a dysfunctional counterfeit in its place.  An easy example would be the social media-based campaign to promote *'vigilante \[in\]justice'* against anyone even baselessly accused of being *'a p█dophile'*, which of course shirks the duty to uphold the God-given rights of *'due diligence'*, *'fair trial'* and *'presumed innocence'* until and unless guilt is proven.  By inciting the public to jettison the upholding of God-given rights in the supposed interests of *'upholding rights'*, *'keeping society cle█n'* and *'thwarting the nifferous Deep State p█dos'*, we see a plain example of how sociopolitics and law are subverted not just by the extremist zealots on *'the l█ft'* p█shing for absurd new models, but also by those on *'the right'* advocating for what seems to be valid principles and heritage law yet definitely isn't.
